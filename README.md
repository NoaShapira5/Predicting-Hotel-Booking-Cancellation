# Predicting-Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
Machine Learning project

Details:  
Course Name: Introduction to Machine Learning  
Name: Noa Shapira and Tomer Blum  

This project is the final project in the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course at the Faculty of Engineering, as a part of the BS.c degree 'Digital Sciences for High-Tech' in Tel Aviv University. In this project, we received a large data-set file containing information about hotel bookings and cancellations. The project goal is to predict whether a particular order may be canceled or not. During the project, we used different tools for analyzing the data and preprocessing it. For example, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and seaborn. Finally, we used machine learning models for predicting whether a particular order may be canceled or not (using the sklearn package). The project was written in python.
